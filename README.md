# ChimeHack Hackathon Project

#### Vital Voices Challenge

There are about 14,000 women connected to Vital Voices, but not with one another. Vital Voices would like a tool to help facilitate collaboration after women go through leadership training.

#### Our Solution

The web app we built offers women leaders three primary benefits:

1. A unified space for women to voice their experience
2. An opportunity to stand with other women leaders around the world
3. A metric that measures the impact of collaboration

We used Meteor for the framework and Leaflet for the map.
